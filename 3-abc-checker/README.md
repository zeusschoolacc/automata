# OUTPUT 3: PROGRAM 3

Write a program that accepts the language L = { aⁿbⁿcⁿ | n ≥ 0 }. The program should output “YES” if the input string w ∈ {a, b, c} is in L, and “NO” if it is not. For example, the input “aabbcc” yields “YES” since aabbcc ∈ L, while the input “bbaaccc” yields “NO” since bbaaccc ∉ L.
